# Instaverse

> Instagram, reverse engineered


## What is this?

This is a very rough attempt of mine at reverse-engineering Instagram's internal API to make a new mobile (and possibly web?) client.


## Tech I'll use

I haven't really decided yet, but I plan to use Flutter for the mobile app. If I end up making a web app as well, I'll likely use Preact (or maybe React).


## Q&A

### What are the `for-later` files?
Totally not the result of me misspelling the module IDs.

### Why did you start this project?
Try using Instagram on an iPad. If you are audacious enough, try using the UWP app as well.

### Is this finished yet?
